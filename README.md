# Color Scheme Generator

Welcome to the Color Scheme Generator, a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that empowers you to effortlessly create beautiful color schemes for your projects.

## Features

### Seed Color Selection

Choose the base color for your color scheme using the user-friendly color picker input. Pick a color that sets the tone and mood you're aiming for in your project.

### Color Scheme Modes

Customize your color scheme by selecting from a variety of color scheme modes available in the dropdown menu. From complementary to triadic, this tool provides a diverse set of options to suit your design needs.

### Color Scheme Generation

With just a click of a button, the Color Scheme Generator makes a request to The Color API, a powerful color manipulation service. It fetches a harmonious set of colors based on your chosen seed color and color scheme mode.

### Display Color Scheme

The generated color scheme is beautifully displayed on the page, giving you an immediate visual representation of how the colors work together. Hex values for each color are conveniently provided, making it easy to integrate them into your project's code.

### Copy Hex Values

You can simply click on the hex values of the colors in the generated scheme to copy them to your clipboard. This streamlines your workflow by eliminating the need to manually select and copy hex values.
